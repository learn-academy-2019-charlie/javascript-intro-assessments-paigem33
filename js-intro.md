#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is like a factory that you push different data through to accomplish a task or series of tasks. You would call it when you need to accomplish the tasks assigned to that function.

google: A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.

a method is a function preformed on an class

google: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
A string method would be something like .chatAt() or indexOf()
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
A accessor will only take information from an array, while a mutator will actually change the array. 

google: Accessor methods only let you look at data--they don't change it. Think of them as read-only. Mutator methods let you change data.  To put this a different way, they're read-write capable.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
When you use a console.log() you are telling something to actually show in the console. Return is what would be logged internally for the program to with itself. 

google: "console.log" is a way for the machine to tell you, the programmer something and "return" is a mechanism for the machine to tell another part of its program something.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
Honestly just working in pairs was really helpful, I'm one of those people who learns really well by talking it out and explain things to other people so always having someone there to do that with was really helpful.
